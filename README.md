# Arcolinux Victory-Edition

# Forked from ArcoLinuxD Gnome desktop

This is a personal setup of Arcolinux. I make this available to anyone to use or change.

This is a continual work in progress to try to create as close to an automated setup as I can.

Scripts to achieve Arcolinux Victory Edition the long way.

# Installation Process


This is NOT a silent install

you will be asked several questions as it progresses



Run the ArcoLinuxD Iso to install the Arch framework.
      
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/arcolinux/files/ArcoLinuxD/

Run these commands in this order:


    git clone https://github.com/VictoryLinux/victory-arco

    chmod +x ~/victory-arco/*.sh 

    cd victory-arco
    
1.) If you want to install Gnome DE
    
    ./arcosetup-gnome.sh
    
If you run this one first, it should continue to the second script automatically

    
2.) If you have already installed Gnome DE
    
    ./arcosetup-victory.sh
    
you will be asked several questions as it progresses, when it reboots you should be good to go.

I want to thank Erik Dubois and the ArcoLinux team for the countless hours he/they have put in to bring us such an incredably stunning and stable distro. I have learned so much from his youtube videos and the content on his websites. Thanks so much
